We're making our own tribute to Disney's *Club Penguin Island*. It's just for fun
and to learn about making games and coding. We're using the Unity engine and hand-drawn art.

We are:

**Ben**, eight years old: Producer, Director, Lead Artist.
**Mark**, many years old: Lead Coder and Breaker of Builds.

We'll be using this blog to share updates and things we learn as we work on our project.
